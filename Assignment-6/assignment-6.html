Q.6 Whats Polymorphism and Purpose of it?

amswer:-

Polymorphism is a key principle of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects. The word "polymorphism" is derived from two Greek words: "poly," meaning many, and "morph," meaning forms. In programming, polymorphism allows a single method or function to behave differently based on the type of object it operates on.

The purpose of polymorphism is to provide a unified interface to different classes or objects, allowing them to be used interchangeably. It promotes code reuse, flexibility, and extensibility in OOP. Here are the main purposes and benefits of polymorphism:

Code Reusability: Polymorphism promotes code reuse by allowing a single method or function to work with multiple classes that share a common interface or superclass. This reduces code duplication and increases the efficiency of code maintenance.

Flexibility: Polymorphism provides flexibility in designing and using classes. It allows developers to create new classes that implement a common interface, making it easy to add new functionality to existing code without modifying the existing code.

Interface Standardization: Polymorphism allows developers to define a standard interface using abstract classes or interfaces. Concrete classes that implement this interface can then be used interchangeably without needing to know the specific implementation details.

Method Overriding: Polymorphism enables method overriding, where a subclass can provide its own implementation for a method defined in its superclass. This allows each subclass to customize the behavior of a common method according to its specific needs.

Run-Time Flexibility: Polymorphism provides run-time flexibility, allowing the program to determine the actual object type and choose the appropriate method implementation dynamically during run-time.

Code Modularity: Polymorphism helps in achieving code modularity by separating the interface or contract from the implementation details. This improves the readability and maintainability of the codebase.

Types of Polymorphism:

Compile-Time Polymorphism: Also known as static polymorphism, it is achieved through method overloading. In method overloading, two or more methods have the same name but different parameter lists, allowing the compiler to choose the appropriate method based on the number or types of arguments passed.

Run-Time Polymorphism: Also known as dynamic polymorphism, it is achieved through method overriding. In method overriding, a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The actual method called is determined at run-time based on the actual type of the object being referenced.
