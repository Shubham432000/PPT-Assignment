Q.9 Explain Class in JavaScript?

answer:-

In JavaScript, a class is a template or blueprint for creating objects with similar properties and behaviors. It defines a new data type, specifying the structure and behavior that objects of that class should have. Classes in JavaScript were introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) and provide a more organized and familiar way to create object-oriented code.

JavaScript classes use a syntax that resembles traditional class-based languages like Java and C++, but it is important to note that JavaScript's class implementation is based on prototypal inheritance, not classical inheritance.

Here's the syntax to define a class in JavaScript:


class ClassName {
  // Constructor method (optional)
  constructor(property1, property2, ...) {
    this.property1 = property1;
    this.property2 = property2;
    // ... and so on
  }

  // Method 1
  methodName1() {
    // Method logic here
  }

  // Method 2
  methodName2() {
    // Method logic here
  }

  // ... and so on
}
Explanation of the components:

Constructor: The constructor method is a special method that gets called when an object is created from the class. It is used to initialize the properties of the object. The constructor is optional, but if it exists, it should be defined within the class.

Properties: Properties are variables that hold data specific to each object created from the class. They are defined using the this keyword within the constructor or any other method in the class.

Methods: Methods are functions that define the behavior of the objects created from the class. They are defined within the class using regular function syntax.

Once a class is defined, you can create objects (instances) from it using the new keyword:


const obj = new ClassName(arg1, arg2, ...);
Where arg1, arg2, etc., are the arguments passed to the constructor if it is defined.

Example:


class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
const person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

person1.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."
person2.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Bob and I am 25 years old."
In this example, we have defined a Person class with a constructor to initialize name and age properties and a sayHello method to display a greeting message. We then create two Person objects and call the sayHello method on each of them.
