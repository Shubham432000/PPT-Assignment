Q.5 Whats Abstraction and Its Purpose?

answer:-

Abstraction is one of the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS). It is the process of simplifying complex systems by breaking them down into smaller, more manageable components. In the context of OOPS, abstraction allows us to define the essential characteristics of an object or a class while hiding the unnecessary details.

The purpose of abstraction is to provide a high-level view of an object or a system, focusing on what an object does rather than how it does it. It allows developers to create models that represent real-world entities in a more abstract and understandable way. Here are the main purposes and benefits of abstraction:

Simplification: Abstraction simplifies the representation of complex systems by focusing only on the relevant features and ignoring the irrelevant details. It allows developers to deal with complexity in a more structured and organized manner.

Ease of Understanding: By hiding the internal details, abstraction makes it easier for developers to understand and reason about the behavior and functionality of an object or a class. It provides a clear and concise view of the object's capabilities.

Data Hiding: Abstraction supports the principle of encapsulation by hiding the internal data and implementation details of an object. This helps in data security and prevents unauthorized access to the object's state.

Code Reusability: Abstraction promotes code reusability by creating abstract classes or interfaces that can be used as blueprints for creating multiple concrete classes. By defining common methods and properties in an abstract class, developers can create subclasses that inherit and extend the functionality.

Maintenance and Scalability: Abstraction simplifies maintenance and scalability as changes made to the implementation details of an object do not affect the external code that interacts with it. This separation of concerns allows for better modular design and easier updates.

System Design: Abstraction plays a crucial role in system design by breaking down the system into smaller, more manageable parts. It allows developers to work on different modules independently, making the design more maintainable and extensible
