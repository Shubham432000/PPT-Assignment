Q.7  Whats Inheritance and Purpose of it?

answer:-

Inheritance is one of the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPS) that allows a class (called a subclass or derived class) to inherit properties and behaviors from another class (called a superclass or base class). It is the mechanism by which one class acquires the attributes and methods of another class, promoting code reuse and establishing hierarchical relationships between classes.

The purpose of inheritance is to create a hierarchical structure of classes that represent real-world relationships or hierarchical categorizations. It enables the subclass to reuse and extend the functionality of the superclass, saving development time and improving code organization. Here are the main purposes and benefits of inheritance:

Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reusability by allowing a subclass to inherit the properties and methods of its superclass. Instead of writing the same code multiple times for similar classes, developers can define common attributes and methods in a base class and then extend or modify them in derived classes.

Hierarchy and Relationships: Inheritance enables the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes. For example, a general "Animal" class can be a superclass, and more specific classes like "Dog," "Cat," and "Bird" can be subclasses, inheriting attributes and methods from the "Animal" class.

Method Overriding: Inheritance supports method overriding, where a subclass can provide its own implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. This allows subclasses to customize the behavior of inherited methods to suit their specific needs.

Encapsulation and Abstraction: Inheritance promotes encapsulation and abstraction by allowing developers to group related attributes and methods in a base class. This separation of concerns makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.

Polymorphism: Inheritance is closely related to polymorphism. When objects of different subclasses are treated as objects of the same superclass, it enables polymorphism. This means that a single interface (supertype) can represent multiple types of objects, promoting flexibility and adaptability in the code.

Code Extensibility: Inheritance allows developers to extend the functionality of existing classes without modifying the original class. New features can be added in the derived class, leaving the original class unchanged. This helps maintain the integrity of the existing codebase.

Types of Inheritance:

Single Inheritance: A subclass inherits from only one superclass. Most object-oriented programming languages, like Java and C#, support single inheritance.

Multiple Inheritance: A subclass inherits from two or more superclasses. Some languages, like C++, allow multiple inheritance, but it can lead to ambiguity and complexity in the code.

Multilevel Inheritance: A subclass inherits from another subclass, creating a chain of inheritance.

Hierarchical Inheritance: Multiple subclasses inherit from a single superclass, forming a hierarchical relationship.
