Q.1 Whatâ€™s Constructor And Its Purpose?

answer:-

In object-oriented programming, a constructor is a special method or function that is used to initialize and create objects of a class. It is called automatically when a new object is created and serves the purpose of setting the initial state of the object and performing any necessary setup.

The constructor is usually defined with the same name as the class it belongs to. In some programming languages, such as JavaScript, the constructor is denoted by the constructor keyword.

The main purposes of a constructor are:

Object Initialization: The constructor is responsible for initializing the object's properties or attributes with default values or values provided as arguments during object creation.

Memory Allocation and Resource Allocation: The constructor may allocate memory or allocate other resources that the object needs to operate correctly.

Setup and Configuration: The constructor can perform any setup or configuration tasks needed by the object before it is ready to be used.

Enforcing Constraints: The constructor can enforce certain constraints or business rules to ensure that the object's state is valid and consistent.

Here's an example of a constructor in JavaScript:


class Person {
  constructor(name, age) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }

  sayHello() {
    console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I am ${this.age} years old.`);
  }
}

const person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
person1.sayHello(); // Output: "Hello, my name is Alice and I am 30 years old."
In this example, the Person class has a constructor that takes name and age as arguments and initializes the name and age properties of the object. When a new Person object is created using the new keyword, the constructor is automatically called, setting the initial state of the object.
