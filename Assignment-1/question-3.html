Q.3 Differentiate between HTML Tags and Elements? 

Answer:-

HTML tags and
elements are related but distinct concepts in HTML. HTML Tags: HTML tags are the
markup elements used to define the structure and presentation of content in an
HTML document. Tags are represented by angle brackets (< and >) and surround
specific content or elements. They typically come in pairs: an opening tag and a
closing tag. For example,
<p>is the opening tag for a paragraph, and</p>
is the closing tag. Tags provide instructions to web browsers about how to
render and display the content. HTML Elements: HTML elements consist of an
opening tag, the content (text or other nested elements), and a closing tag.
Elements are the building blocks of an HTML document and represent specific
types of content or sections. Elements are created by enclosing content within
tags. For example, the paragraph element is represented by the
<p>
  tags, and any text or nested elements between those tags are part of the
  paragraph element. To illustrate the difference, consider the following
  example: html Copy code
</p>

<p>This is a paragraph element.</p>
In this example,
<p>
  is the opening tag, This is a paragraph element. is the content of the
  element, and
</p>
is the closing tag. Together, they form the paragraph element, which is used to
indicate that the enclosed content is a paragraph.
