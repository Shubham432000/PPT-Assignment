Q.1 <!DOCTYPE html> is it a tag of html? If not, what is it and why do we use
it? Answer:- <!DOCTYPE html> is not a tag in HTML; it is called a document type
declaration (DTD). It is used to specify the version of HTML that the document
is written in. The document type declaration is placed at the very beginning of
an HTML document, before the
<html>
  tag. It informs the web browser or parser about the rules and specifications
  to be used when interpreting the HTML code.
</html>
In the case of <!DOCTYPE html>, it is the document type declaration for HTML5,
which is the latest version of the HTML specification. HTML5 introduced new
elements, attributes, and improved support for multimedia and scripting, making
it the most widely used and recommended version of HTML.
