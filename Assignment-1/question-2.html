Q.2 Explain Semantic tags in html? And why do we need it?


Answer:- Semantic tags
in HTML are specific HTML elements that carry meaning and describe the structure
and content of the web page. These tags provide a way to convey the intended
meaning of the different sections of a web page to both browsers and search
engines. Semantic tags include elements such as

<header>, <nav>, <section>, <article>, <aside>, <footer>, <main>, <figure>, and many others. Each of these tags represents a specific section or type of content on the web page.

    Here are a few examples of semantic tags and their purposes:
    
    <header>: Represents the introductory content or the container for a group of introductory content at the top of the web page.
    <nav>: Represents a section of navigation links.
    <section>: Defines a standalone section with its own theme or topic.
    <article>: Represents a self-contained composition that can be independently distributed or syndicated.
    <aside>: Represents content that is tangentially related to the main content, often presented as sidebars or callouts.
    <footer>: Represents the footer section of the web page or a specific section's footer.
    <main>: Represents the main content area of the web page.
    <figure>: Represents a self-contained content block that is referenced from the main content.
