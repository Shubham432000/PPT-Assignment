Q.9 Whatâ€™s the difference between html tag and attribute and give example of
some global attributes?
 Answer:-
  In HTML, tags and attributes are distinct
concepts. HTML Tags: HTML tags define the structure and elements of an HTML
document. They are used to mark up and enclose specific parts of the content.
Tags are represented by opening and closing angle brackets (< and >) and are
typically used in pairs. For example,
<p>is the opening tag for a paragraph, and</p>
is the closing tag. Example of an HTML tag:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
HTML Attributes: HTML attributes provide additional information or modify the
behavior of HTML elements. They are placed within the opening tag of an element
and consist of a name-value pair. Attributes provide extra details about how an
element should be displayed or function. They are specified using the attribute
name followed by an equals sign (=) and the attribute value enclosed in
quotation marks.

Example of an HTML attribute

<img src="image.jpg" alt="Image description">
In the example above, the src and alt attributes are used with the <img> tag. The src attribute specifies the image source (URL or file path), and the alt attribute provides alternative text for the image.

Global Attributes: Global attributes are attributes that can be used with any HTML element, regardless of the element's specific purpose or type. These attributes provide common functionality and behavior that can be applied universally. Some examples of global attributes are:

class: Specifies one or more class names for an element, allowing it to be styled or targeted using CSS or JavaScript.
id: Specifies a unique identifier for an element, which can be used to target it with CSS or JavaScript.
