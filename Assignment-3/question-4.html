Q.4 What is the purpose of using Media Queries for Print Media?

Answer:-

The purpose of using Media Queries for print media in CSS is to create a separate and optimized layout specifically designed for printing documents from a web page. Media Queries allow you to apply different styles when the content is printed, ensuring that the printed output is well-formatted, easy to read, and doesn't waste unnecessary resources like colors or backgrounds that may not be suitable for print.

By using Media Queries for print media, you can:

Control Page Layout: You can adjust the layout and formatting of the content to make it more suitable for printing on paper. This includes setting margins, page size, headers, footers, and page breaks.

Remove Non-Essential Elements: You can hide or remove non-essential elements that are not relevant for the printed version. For example, you may want to exclude navigation menus, sidebars, or images that are not essential for the printed document.

Optimize Font Sizes: You can adjust font sizes to ensure that the printed text is easily readable. Larger font sizes may be more appropriate for printed documents compared to screen-based designs.

Customize Styling: You can customize colors, backgrounds, and other styling elements to suit the printing medium. For example, you may want to use black and white colors to save ink or choose a printer-friendly color scheme.

Here's an example of using a Media Query for print media in CSS:

/* Default styles for screen media */
.some-class {
  /* Some styles here */
}

/* Media Query for print media */
@media print {
  .some-class {
    /* CSS rules to apply for printing */
    font-size: 14px;
    margin: 10mm;
    color: black;
    background: none;
    /* Other print-specific styles */
  }
}

In this example, the .some-class element has different styles for screen media (the default) and for print media. When the content is printed, the styles inside the @media print block will be applied.

By using Media Queries for print media, you can create a print-friendly version of your web page, ensuring that users get a well-formatted and optimized document when they print from your website.
