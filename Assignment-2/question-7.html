Q.7 Whatâ€™s Grid & Flex and difference between them?

Answer:-

Grid and Flexbox are CSS layout systems that provide different approaches to creating responsive and flexible web page layouts. Here's a comparison of Grid and Flexbox:

Grid Layout:

Grid layout is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex grid structures with rows and columns.
It is defined on the parent container using the display: grid property.
Grids are created by dividing the container into rows and columns using the grid-template-rows and grid-template-columns properties.
Grid items can be placed anywhere in the grid using properties like grid-row and grid-column.
Grid offers precise control over the layout and alignment of both rows and columns.
It excels at creating grid-based designs with consistent spacing and alignment across multiple elements.
Grid layout is well-suited for creating overall page layouts.

Flexbox:

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system that primarily focuses on arranging elements in a single row or column.
It is defined on the parent container using the display: flex property.
Flexbox items automatically flex to fill the available space along the main axis (row or column) of the container.
Flexbox provides properties like justify-content and align-items to control the alignment and spacing of items along the main and cross axes.
It is excellent for creating flexible and responsive components like navigation menus, flexible card layouts, and vertical centering of elements.
Flexbox is often used for creating dynamic and adaptable layouts within a component or section of a web page.
Main Differences:

Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout system, while Grid is a two-dimensional layout system.
Grid provides a grid structure with rows and columns, whereas Flexbox primarily focuses on arranging items in a single row or column.
Grid offers more control and flexibility over both rows and columns, while Flexbox is designed for easier alignment and spacing of items along a single axis.
Grid is suitable for creating overall page layouts, while Flexbox is commonly used for creating flexible and responsive components within a layout.
In practice, Grid and Flexbox can be used together, as they serve different purposes. By leveraging the strengths of both layout systems, you can create sophisticated and responsive web page designs with precise control over overall page structure (Grid) and individual component layouts (Flexbox).
