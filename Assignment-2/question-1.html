Q.1 Whatâ€™s Box Model in CSS ? 
Answer:-
 The Box Model is a fundamental concept in
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) that describes how elements on a web page are
structured and how their dimensions and spacing are calculated. In the Box
Model, every element is represented as a rectangular box, which consists of four
main components: Content: It is the actual content of the element, such as text,
images, or other media. The content area's size is determined by the width and
height properties. Padding: It is the space between the content and the
element's border. The padding can be set using the padding property and affects
the area around the content. Border: It is a line that surrounds the element's
padding and content. The border's style, width, and color can be defined using
the border property. Margin: It is the space between the element's border and
neighboring elements. The margin provides the gap between elements on a page and
can be set using the margin property.
