Q.5 How is Border-box different from Content Box?
 Answer:- 
 In CSS, the
box-sizing property allows you to control how the total width and height of an
element are calculated, including the content, padding, and border. There are
two main values for the box-sizing property: content-box and border-box.
Content-box (default): When an element has box-sizing: content-box, the width
and height values specified for the element only include the content area. The
padding and border are added to the specified width and height values, resulting
in the total size of the element being larger than the specified dimensions. In
other words, the width and height properties define only the size of the content
area, and the padding and border are added to that size. For example, if you set
an element's width to 200 pixels and add 10 pixels of padding and a 2-pixel
border, the total width of the element will be 224 pixels (200 pixels for
content + 10 pixels for padding on the left + 10 pixels for padding on the right
+ 2 pixels for the left border + 2 pixels for the right border). Border-box:
When an element has box-sizing: border-box, the specified width and height
values include the content area, padding, and border. In other words, the width
and height properties define the total size of the element, including the
content, padding, and border. The padding and border values are subtracted from
the specified width and height, ensuring that the content area remains the size
you've specified. Using the same example as before, if you set an element's
width to 200 pixels and add 10 pixels of padding and a 2-pixel border, the total
width of the element will be exactly 200 pixels. The width includes the content,
padding, and border, and the browser automatically adjusts the content area size
to fit within the specified width. The key difference between content-box and
border-box is how the width and height properties are interpreted and how the
padding and border affect the size of the element. With content-box, the width
and height are exclusive of padding and border, whereas with border-box, the
width and height include the padding and border. border-box is particularly
useful for layout purposes as it simplifies the calculation of element sizes and
helps maintain consistent dimensions, especially when working with complex
layouts and nested elements. It allows you to more easily control the overall
size of an element, including its content, padding, and border.
