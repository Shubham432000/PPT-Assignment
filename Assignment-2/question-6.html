Q.6 Whatâ€™s z-index and How does it Function ? 
Answer:-
 The z-index property in
CSS controls the stacking order of positioned elements on a web page along the
z-axis. The z-axis is a conceptual axis that represents the depth or elevation
of elements on the page. The z-index property assigns a numerical value to an
element, determining its position relative to other elements in the stacking
order. The higher the z-index value, the closer the element is to the viewer,
appearing in front of elements with lower z-index values. If two elements have
the same z-index, their stacking order is determined by their position in the
HTML structure (the element that comes later in the HTML will be displayed on
top). Here's how z-index functions: Stacking Context: Each positioned element
with a z-index value other than auto (the default value) creates a stacking
context. A stacking context is a hierarchical structure that determines the
order in which elements are displayed. Elements within the same stacking context
are stacked relative to each other, and the stacking contexts can overlap or
nest. Element Hierarchy: Elements within the same stacking context are stacked
based on their z-index values. An element with a higher z-index value will be
displayed in front of elements with lower z-index values within the same
stacking context. If elements have the same z-index, their order is determined
by the order of appearance in the HTML structure. Stacking Order: The stacking
order starts from the lowest positioned element in the HTML structure and
proceeds to higher positioned elements within the same stacking context.
Elements outside any stacking context (or without a z-index value) are stacked
below elements with stacking contexts. It's important to note that the z-index
property works only on positioned elements, such as those with position:
relative, position: absolute, or position: fixed. Non-positioned elements
(elements with the default position: static) are unaffected by z-index. By
adjusting the z-index values of elements, you can control their visual layering
and determine which elements appear in front of or behind others. This property
is commonly used for creating overlays, dropdown menus, tooltips, and managing
the stacking order of elements in complex layouts.
