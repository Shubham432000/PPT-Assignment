Q.4 Whats difference between Inline, Inline Block and block ?

Answer:-

Inline, inline-block, and block are display property values in CSS that determine how elements are rendered and positioned in relation to other elements. Here's the difference between them:

Inline: Elements with the display property set to "inline" are rendered in a line, one after another, without starting a new line. They do not create line breaks and only take up the necessary width and height to contain their content. Examples of inline elements are <span>, <a>, and <strong>. Inline elements cannot have fixed width or height, and margin and padding properties only affect the left and right sides, not top and bottom. Inline elements cannot contain block-level elements.

Inline-block: Elements with the display property set to "inline-block" are rendered as inline elements but behave like block-level elements in terms of width, height, and box model properties. They respect width and height settings and can have margin and padding applied on all sides. Inline-block elements are placed horizontally in a line but can have vertical alignment. They can also contain block-level elements within them. Examples of inline-block elements include <img> and <input>.

Block: Elements with the display property set to "block" are rendered as block-level elements, starting on a new line and taking up the full width available. Block-level elements occupy the entire width of their parent element by default, and their width and height can be explicitly set. They stack vertically on top of each other, and margin and padding properties apply on all sides. Examples of block-level elements include <div>, <p>, and <h1> to <h6>.

In summary, the key differences between inline, inline-block, and block elements are related to their behavior regarding line breaks, sizing, positioning, and the ability to contain other elements. Inline elements don't create line breaks, inline-block elements behave like inline but respect width and height, and block elements start on a new line and occupy the full width available.
