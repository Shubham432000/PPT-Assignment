Q.3 What is VW/VH ? 
Answer:-
 VW (viewport width) and VH (viewport height) are
CSS units that allow you to specify lengths or sizes relative to the size of the
browser viewport. VW (Viewport Width): The VW unit represents a percentage of
the width of the viewport. 1 VW is equal to 1% of the viewport width. For
example, if the viewport width is 1000 pixels, 1 VW would be equivalent to 10
pixels (1% of 1000). This unit is useful for creating fluid and responsive
layouts that adjust proportionally to the width of the viewport. VH (Viewport
Height): The VH unit represents a percentage of the height of the viewport. 1 VH
is equal to 1% of the viewport height. For example, if the viewport height is
800 pixels, 1 VH would be equivalent to 8 pixels (1% of 800). VH is often used
for vertical sizing or positioning of elements in a responsive design. Both VW
and VH units are relative to the viewport size, which means that they
automatically adjust when the browser window is resized or when the website is
viewed on different devices with varying screen sizes. These units can be useful
for creating responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes. By using
VW and VH units, you can ensure that elements on your web page scale
proportionally, maintaining a consistent layout and visual balance across
various devices and screen resolutions.
