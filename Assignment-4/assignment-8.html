Q.8 How can you destructure objects and arrays in ES6?

answer:-

In ECMAScript 6 (ES6), destructuring is a powerful feature that allows you to extract values from arrays or properties from objects and assign them to variables in a concise and convenient way. Destructuring is a shorthand syntax that simplifies the process of accessing and unpacking elements from arrays or objects.

Destructuring Arrays:
To destructure an array, you use square brackets [] on the left-hand side of the assignment, and on the right-hand side, you provide the array from which you want to extract values.

Example:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3];

// Destructuring array
const [a, b, c] = numbers;

console.log(a); // Output: 1
console.log(b); // Output: 2
console.log(c); // Output: 3


Destructuring Objects:
To destructure an object, you use curly braces {} on the left-hand side of the assignment, and on the right-hand side, you provide the object from which you want to extract properties. The variable names on the left-hand side should match the property names in the object.

Example:

const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 30,
  };
  
  // Destructuring object
  const { firstName, lastName, age } = person;
  
  console.log(firstName); // Output: John
  console.log(lastName); // Output: Doe
  console.log(age); // Output: 30

  
  Renaming Variables:
You can also use the destructuring syntax to rename variables during assignment. To do this, you specify the new variable name followed by a colon : before the property or array element you want to extract.

Example

const person = {
    firstName: 'John',
    lastName: 'Doe',
    age: 30,
  };
  
  // Destructuring object with renaming
  const { firstName: fName, lastName: lName, age: personAge } = person;
  
  console.log(fName); // Output: John
  console.log(lName); // Output: Doe
  console.log(personAge); // Output: 30

  Default Values:
You can also provide default values in case the property or array element being destructured is undefined.

Example:
const numbers = [1, 2];

// Destructuring array with default value
const [a, b, c = 3] = numbers;

console.log(a); // Output: 1
console.log(b); // Output: 2
console.log(c); // Output: 3 (default value)
