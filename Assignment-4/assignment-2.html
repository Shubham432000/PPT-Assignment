Q.2 Explain Temporal Dead Zone?
 Answer:- Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a behavior
in JavaScript that occurs when trying to access a variable before it has been
initialized with a value. It happens with variables declared using let and const
keywords. The TDZ is a period of time starting from the beginning of the scope
(block or function) where the variable is declared and ending at the point where
it is initialized. During the TDZ, any attempt to read or access the variable
will result in a ReferenceError. The variable exists in the scope, but it is in
an uninitialized state, and trying to access it before it is assigned a value is
not allowed. Here's an example to illustrate the Temporal Dead Zone:

console.log(x); // Throws ReferenceError: Cannot access 'x' before
initialization let x = 10; 

In this example, we're trying to access the variable
x before it is initialized with the value 10. This will throw a ReferenceError
due to the Temporal Dead Zone. The Temporal Dead Zone is a feature introduced in
ECMAScript 6 (ES6) when let and const declarations were introduced. Before ES6,
trying to access a variable before its declaration would result in an undefined
value. It's important to understand the Temporal Dead Zone to write correct and
predictable JavaScript code. To avoid TDZ errors, always make sure to declare
your variables before accessing them and ensure that they are properly
initialized before use.
