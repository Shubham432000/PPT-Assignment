Q.6  What is template literals in ES6 and how do you use them?

answer:-

Template literals, also known as template strings, are a new feature introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that allows developers to create more expressive and flexible strings in JavaScript. Template literals are enclosed in backticks (``) instead of single or double quotes.

Template literals provide the following advantages over traditional strings:

String Interpolation: Template literals allow easy embedding of variables and expressions within the string using ${}. This is called string interpolation and makes it simpler to include dynamic values in the string.

Multi-line Strings: Template literals can span multiple lines without the need for escape characters or concatenation, making multiline strings more readable.

Expression Evaluation: The expressions inside ${} are evaluated, and their results are included in the string. This allows for more complex string construction and dynamic content.

Here's an example of using template literals:

const name = 'John';
const age = 30;

// Traditional string concatenation
const message1 = 'Hello, my name is ' + name + ' and I am ' + age + ' years old.';
console.log(message1);

// Using template literals
const message2 = `Hello, my name is ${name} and I am ${age} years old.`;
console.log(message2);


Output:

Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.
Hello, my name is John and I am 30 years old.


As you can see, both message1 and message2 produce the same output. However, using template literals with string interpolation (${}) is more concise and easier to read, especially when working with multiple variables or expressions in the string.

Additionally, template literals can be used for multiline strings:

const multilineMessage = `
  This is a multiline string
  that spans across multiple lines.
  It is much easier to create
  and read multiline strings using
  template literals in ES6.
`;

console.log(multilineMessage);


const multilineMessage = `
  This is a multiline string
  that spans across multiple lines.
  It is much easier to create
  and read multiline strings using
  template literals in ES6.
`;

console.log(multilineMessage);


const multilineMessage = `
  This is a multiline string
  that spans across multiple lines.
  It is much easier to create
  and read multiline strings using
  template literals in ES6.
`;

console.log(multilineMessage);
