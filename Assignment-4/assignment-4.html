Q.4 What are the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6?

answer:-

ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ECMAScript 2015, brought significant enhancements and new features to JavaScript. Some of the major features introduced in ECMAScript 6 include:

Block-Scoped Declarations (let and const): Introduced the let and const keywords for declaring variables with block-level scope, addressing the limitations of var which had function-level scope.

Arrow Functions: Introduced concise syntax for writing functions using the => arrow notation, making it easier to write anonymous functions and handling lexical scoping of this.

Classes: Introduced class syntax for defining classes in JavaScript, offering a more familiar way to define and work with object-oriented code.

Modules: Introduced native support for modules, allowing developers to import and export modules to organize code into reusable components and better manage dependencies.

Default Parameters: Added the ability to set default values for function parameters, simplifying function definitions and providing fallback values.

Destructuring Assignment: Introduced syntax for easily extracting values from arrays and objects into variables, improving code readability and reducing the need for temporary variables.

Spread Operator: Introduced the spread operator ..., which allows spreading elements from an iterable (like an array or object) into another array, object, or function argument.

Rest Parameters: Introduced the rest parameter syntax ..., which allows capturing multiple function arguments into a single array, simplifying function definitions.

Template Literals: Introduced a new way to create strings using backticks (``) to allow embedding expressions directly within the string using ${}.

Enhanced Object Literals: Introduced shorthand property names, computed property names, and methods within object literals, making object creation more concise and flexible.

Promises: Introduced native support for Promises, providing a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations and avoiding callback hell.

Iterators and Iterables: Introduced the concept of iterators and iterables, enabling custom iteration over data structures using the for...of loop.

Generators: Introduced generator functions using the function* syntax, allowing pausing and resuming function execution and creating iterable sequences.

Symbols: Introduced a new primitive data type Symbol that can be used as unique property keys, helping to avoid potential name conflicts.

Map and Set Data Structures: Introduced Map and Set data structures, providing efficient key-value mapping and storing unique values without duplicates.
